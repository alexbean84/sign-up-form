# sign-up-form
Hello! This is a sign up form which was made using CSS
and JavaScript. I made this project in order to showcase
my CSS and JavaScript skills. This sign up form allows
the user to enter a username, an email, a password and
a second password (confirm password) in order to login
on a certain website.

This is Project: Sign-up Form from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form

GitHub Code Files: https://github.com/alexbean84/sign-up-form

What I learned:
- How to use CSS in order to design a sign up form
- How to use a few of the basic built-in HTML validations
- How to create JS functions which validate if the entered
input is either correct or not
